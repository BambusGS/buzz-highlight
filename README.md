# Buzz Syntax Highlighting for VS Code

A simple syntax highlighting extension for the Buzz programming language (.bzz files).

## About

This extension was created by a WPI student during one of those long, exhausting nights of coding. Despite being tired, confused, and ready to collapse, I managed to put together this syntax highlighter to make working with Buzz code a bit more bearable.

The Buzz language itself was developed by Carlo Pinciroli at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and is available at [https://github.com/buzz-lang](https://github.com/buzz-lang).

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for .bzz files
- Supports Buzz language keywords, operators, and built-in functions
- Makes your code look prettier when you're debugging at 3 AM

## Installation

1. Download the extension
2. In VS Code, go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Click on the "..." at the top of the Extensions panel
4. Select "Install from VSIX..."
5. Choose the downloaded extension file
6. Enjoy syntax highlighting (and maybe get some sleep)

## Usage

The extension automatically activates when you open a .bzz file in VS Code.

## Supported Syntax

- Keywords: var, function, if, else, while, for, foreach, include, return, nil, and, or, not
- Built-in functions: log, size, foreach, map, reduce, print
- Comments, strings, numbers, operators
